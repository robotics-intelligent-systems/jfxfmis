Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) are ICT-based tools that support farmers and value chain actors in making data-driven decisions to improve their operations. FMIS can benefit various stakeholders in agricultural value chains and enable innovations in smallholder inclusive business models. They help in engaging with farmers more efficiently and effectively while creating value. FMIS are implemented by businesses to simplify the collection, aggregation, and analysis of last-mile farmer data, which can be used to determine services to provide to farmers, manage sourcing activities, and automate farmer payments.
